# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree (SDCe-ND)

In this repository I'll track my completed projects for the Udacity [Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).


## Projects

### Lane Line Detection
Determine region of interest using a polygon, grayscaling and blurring, determine edges using Canny Edge Detection and transform these into Hough space to find the lane lanes in a video.

### Advanced Lane Line Detection
Determine region of interest using a polygon, grayscaling and blurring, determine edges using Canny Edge Detection and transform these into Hough space to find the lane lanes in a video.

### Traffic Sign Classifier
Classify signs from a large set of German traffic sign images using a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN).
Model structure:

### Behavioral Cloning
Using the provided driving simulator, test data was generated by driving a car around the track. Using the recorded images, steering angles and throttle, the Neural Network was trained to drive the car within the simulator itself:
 


### Extended Kalman Filter (C++)
Using the Extended Kalman Filter equations, an algorithm was developed to predict the car's position (green triangles) and update accordingly with both LIDAR (red dots) and RADAR (blue dots) measurements:
