# Udacity-SCD-Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-nd

In this repository I'll track my completed projects for the Udacity [Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).


## Projects

### Basic Lane Line Detection
Determine region of interest using a polygon, grayscaling and blurring, determine edges using Canny Edge Detection and transform these into Hough space to find the lane lanes in a video.
